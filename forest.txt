Deep in the heart of the ancient wood,
Where trees stand tall and the light is good,
There echoes a melody, soft and clear,
A song of the forest, for all to hear.
It's sung by the birds in their leafy nests,
By the rustling leaves, by the river's crests.
It speaks of harmony, of balance divine,
Of nature's rhythm, in perfect line.
So listen closely, and you will find,
The song of the forest, in every kind.
